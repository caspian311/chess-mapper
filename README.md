# Chess-Mapper

## Purpose

To make the best chess playing program out there... it's a little ambitious but I wanted to try something out.

## Notes

### To get your environment setup

You'll need to run these two commands in two windows. One will keep the lib folder up to date, the other will continually run the tests when the lib or test directory changes.

```
$ npm run-script build-watch
$ npm run-script test-watch
```
